type Requirement is Object {
    """
    Defines a high-level behavioral requirement that the system is expected to adhere to.
    Primarily intended for standards enforcement, though may also be used to capture and
    track explicit business requirements, if one so chooses.
    
    One can do all of their requirements management via objects of this type, if desired.
    But it is expected that more often, teams will use these as placeholders for objects in their
    external requirements management tool, if they use them beyond the system-defined requirements.

    The primary reason for defining requirements and linking them to things like tests and
    services, is to enable automatic test matrix generation.
